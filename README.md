# AI-Solution-with-AzureCommunicationChat

This project demonstrates how to build a conversational bot using the [Microsoft Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com) integrated with [Semantic Kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel). The bot retrieves and summarizes responses from an internal knowledge base to answer user questions in natural language.

## Project Status

This project is under active development and available for public use. Contributions are welcome.

## Prerequisites

Please follow the four steps in [Add a bot to your chat app](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/chat/quickstart-botframework-integration#create-and-deploy-a-bot-in-azure)

1. [Prerequisites](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/chat/quickstart-botframework-integration#prerequisites)
2. [Create and deploy a bot in Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/chat/quickstart-botframework-integration#create-and-deploy-a-bot-in-azure)
3. [Get a Communication Services resource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/chat/quickstart-botframework-integration#get-a-communication-services-resource)

### Steps to deploy this CHATBOT sample
Please follow [the ChatBot Readme](./ChatBot/README.md) to deploy the ChatBot sample to azure.


## How to run the demo
1. Follow the steps in the [Add Chat to your app](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/chat/get-started?pivots=programming-language-csharp&tabs=windows) quickstart to create a chat app and a User Id.
2. Create a chat thread with two participant IDs, the Bot ACS Id created during the prerequisite step and the User Id created in step 1. Save the thread id.
3. Access the [ACS Chat Thread UI](https://azure.github.io/communication-ui-library/?path=/story/composites-chatcomposite-join-existing-chat-thread--join-existing-chat-thread)
4. Provide the required information to join an existing Chat Thread. Below are example questions you can ask your app. AI will retrieve the data relevant to the semantics of the user's question and provided an answer based on the data.
   - question 1: My user ID is 110. I bought a laptop several days ago. Could you help to track the delivery?
   - question 2: I've requested a return for my Power Bank. Any updates?
   - question 3: I bought Bluetooth Earphones 2 days ago, but they havenâ€™t been shipped yet. Why?
